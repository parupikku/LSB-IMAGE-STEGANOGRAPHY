# LSB-IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY
encoding secret data into a BMP image and decoding it to retrieve the hidden message
Implements Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography in BMP images, enabling embedding a secret file into an image and retrieving it with decoding. The project demonstrates bitwise operations, file I/O, and data validation.
